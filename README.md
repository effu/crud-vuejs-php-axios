# Vue CRUD PHP Application

I wanted to test the capabilites of Vue JS and PHP. I looked around for a complete tutorial using Vue and PHP, but I finally put this one together. I saw many tutorials with bits and pieces, but not the whole thing as one. This application uses HTML, JavaScript and PHP to add, change, view and delete records from a database.
